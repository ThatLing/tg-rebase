					Lines are a series of chords, separated by commas (,), each with notes separated by hyphens (-).<br>
					Every note in a chord will play together, with chord timed by the tempo.<br>
					<br>
					Notes are played by the names of the note, and optionally, the accidental, and/or the octave number.<br>
					By default, every note is natural and in octave 3. Defining otherwise is remembered for each note.<br>
					Example: <i>C,D,E,F,G,A,B</i> will play a C major scale.<br>
					After a note has an accidental placed, it will be remembered: <i>C,C4,C,C3</i> is <i>C3,C4,C4,C3</i><br>
					Chords can be played simply by seperating each note with a hyphon: <i>A-C#,Cn-E,E-G#,Gn-B</i><br>
					A pause may be denoted by an empty chord: <i>C,E,,C,G</i><br>
					To make a chord be a different time, end it with /x, where the chord length will be length<br>
					defined by tempo / x: <i>C,G/2,E/4</i><br>
					Combined, an example is: <i>E-E4/4,F#/2,G#/8,B/8,E3-E4/4</i>
					<br>
					Lines may be up to ÿ characters.<br>
					A song may only contain up to ÿ lines.<br>

<B>Hey fellow botanist!</B><BR>
<BR>
I didn't trust the station folk so I left<BR>
a couple of weeks ago. But here's some<BR>
instructions on how to operate things here.<BR>
You can grow plants and each iteration they become<BR>
stronger, more potent and have better yield, if you<BR>
know which ones to pick. Use your botanist's analyzer<BR>
for that. You can turn harvested plants into seeds<BR>
at the seed extractor, and replant them for better stuff!<BR>
Sometimes if the weed level gets high in the tray<BR>
mutations into different mushroom or weed species have<BR>
been witnessed. On the rare occasion even weeds mutate!<BR>
<BR>
Either way, have fun!<BR>
<BR>
Best regards,<BR>
Billy Bob Johnson.<BR>
<BR>
PS.<BR>
Here's a few tips:<BR>
In nettles, potency = damage<BR>
In amanitas, potency = deadliness + side effect<BR>
In Liberty caps, potency = drug power + effect<BR>
In chilies, potency = heat<BR>
<B>Nutrients keep mushrooms alive!</B><BR>
<B>Water keeps weeds such as nettles alive!</B><BR>
<B>All other plants need both.</B>

<B>Remember:</B> do not forget to prepare your spells.
<B>Roles:</B><BR>
The Detective is basically the investigator and prosecutor.<BR>
The Staff Assistant can perform these functions with written authority from the Detective.<BR>
The Captain/HoP/Warden is ct as the judicial authority.<BR>
The Security Officers are responsible for executing warrants, security during trial, and prisoner transport.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Investigative Phase:</B><BR>
After the crime has been committed the Detective's job is to gather evidence and try to ascertain not only who did it but what happened. He must take special care to catalogue everything and don't leave anything out. Write out all the evidence on paper. Make sure you take an appropriate number of fingerprints. IF he must ask someone questions he has permission to confront them. If the person refuses he can ask a judicial authority to write a subpoena for questioning. If again he fails to respond then that person is to be jailed as insubordinate and obstructing justice. Said person will be released after he cooperates.<BR>
<BR>
ONCE the FT has a clear idea as to who the criminal is he is to write an arrest warrant on the piece of paper. IT MUST LIST THE CHARGES. The FT is to then go to the judicial authority and explain a small version of his case. If the case is moderately acceptable the authority should sign it. Security must then execute said warrant.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Pre-Pre-Trial Phase:</B><BR>
Now a legal representative must be presented to the defendant if said defendant requests one. That person and the defendant are then to be given time to meet (in the jail IS ACCEPTABLE). The defendant and his lawyer are then to be given a copy of all the evidence that will be presented at trial (rewriting it all on paper is fine). THIS IS CALLED THE DISCOVERY PACK. With a few exceptions, THIS IS THE ONLY EVIDENCE BOTH SIDES MAY USE AT TRIAL. IF the prosecution will be seeking the death penalty it MUST be stated at this time. ALSO if the defense will be seeking not guilty by mental defect it must state this at this time to allow ample time for examination.<BR>
Now at this time each side is to compile a list of witnesses. By default, the defendant is on both lists regardless of anything else. Also the defense and prosecution can compile more evidence beforehand BUT in order for it to be used the evidence MUST also be given to the other side.
The defense has time to compile motions against some evidence here.<BR>
<B>Possible Motions:</B><BR>
1. <U>Invalidate Evidence-</U> Something with the evidence is wrong and the evidence is to be thrown out. This includes irrelevance or corrupt security.<BR>
2. <U>Free Movement-</U> Basically the defendant is to be kept uncuffed before and during the trial.<BR>
3. <U>Subpoena Witness-</U> If the defense presents god reasons for needing a witness but said person fails to cooperate then a subpoena is issued.<BR>
4. <U>Drop the Charges-</U> Not enough evidence is there for a trial so the charges are to be dropped. The FT CAN RETRY but the judicial authority must carefully reexamine the new evidence.<BR>
5. <U>Declare Incompetent-</U> Basically the defendant is insane. Once this is granted a medical official is to examine the patient. If he is indeed insane he is to be placed under care of the medical staff until he is deemed competent to stand trial.<BR>
<BR>
ALL SIDES MOVE TO A COURTROOM<BR>
<B>Pre-Trial Hearings:</B><BR>
A judicial authority and the 2 sides are to meet in the trial room. NO ONE ELSE BESIDES A SECURITY DETAIL IS TO BE PRESENT. The defense submits a plea. If the plea is guilty then proceed directly to sentencing phase. Now the sides each present their motions to the judicial authority. He rules on them. Each side can debate each motion. Then the judicial authority gets a list of crew members. He first gets a chance to look at them all and pick out acceptable and available jurors. Those jurors are then called over. Each side can ask a few questions and dismiss jurors they find too biased. HOWEVER before dismissal the judicial authority MUST agree to the reasoning.<BR>
<BR>
<B>The Trial:</B><BR>
The trial has three phases.<BR>
1. <B>Opening Arguments</B>- Each side can give a short speech. They may not present ANY evidence.<BR>
2. <B>Witness Calling/Evidence Presentation</B>- The prosecution goes first and is able to call the witnesses on his approved list in any order. He can recall them if necessary. During the questioning the lawyer may use the evidence in the questions to help prove a point. After every witness the other side has a chance to cross-examine. After both sides are done questioning a witness the prosecution can present another or recall one (even the EXACT same one again!). After prosecution is done the defense can call witnesses. After the initial cases are presented both sides are free to call witnesses on either list.<BR>
FINALLY once both sides are done calling witnesses we move onto the next phase.<BR>
3. <B>Closing Arguments</B>- Same as opening.<BR>
The jury then deliberates IN PRIVATE. THEY MUST ALL AGREE on a verdict. REMEMBER: They mix between some charges being guilty and others not guilty (IE if you supposedly killed someone with a gun and you unfortunately picked up a gun without authorization then you CAN be found not guilty of murder BUT guilty of possession of illegal weaponry.). Once they have agreed they present their verdict. If unable to reach a verdict and feel they will never they call a deadlocked jury and we restart at Pre-Trial phase with an entirely new set of jurors.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Sentencing Phase:</B><BR>
If the death penalty was sought (you MUST have gone through a trial for death penalty) then skip to the second part. <BR>
I. Each side can present more evidence/witnesses in any order. There is NO ban on emotional aspects or anything. The prosecution is to submit a suggested penalty. After all the sides are done then the judicial authority is to give a sentence.<BR>
II. The jury stays and does the same thing as I. Their sole job is to determine if the death penalty is applicable. If NOT then the judge selects a sentence.<BR>
<BR>
TADA you're done. Security then executes the sentence and adds the applicable convictions to the person's record.<BR>

<b> XCC-P5831 Visitor Information </b><br>Greetings, visitor, to  XCC-P5831! As you may know, this outpost was once used as Nanotrasen's CENTRAL COMMAND STATION, organizing and coordinating company projects across the vastness of space. <br>Since the completion of the much more efficient CC-A5831 on March 8, 2553, XCC-P5831 no longer acts as NT's base of operations but still plays a very important role its corporate affairs; serving as a supply and repair depot, as well as being host to its most important legal proceedingsand the thrilling pay-per-view broadcasts of <i>PLASTEEL CHEF</i> and <i>THUNDERDOME LIVE</i>.<br> We hope you enjoy your stay!
<b>&lt;&lt;&lt;</b>
<b>*Damage Report*</b><br><br><b>Alpha Station</b> - Destroyed<br><br><b>Beta Station</b> - Catastrophic Damage. Medical, destroyed. Atmospherics, partially destroyed. Engine Core, destroyed.<br><br><b>Charlie Station</b> - Intact. Loss of oxygen to eastern side of main corridor.<br><br><b>Delta Station</b> - Intact. <b>WARNING</b>: Unknown force occupying Delta Station. Intent unknown. Species unknown. Numbers unknown.<br><br>Recommendation - Reestablish station powernet via solar array. Reestablish station atmospherics system to restore air.
<b>*Health Analyser*</b><br><br>The portable Health Analyser is essentially a handheld variant of a health analyser. Years of research have concluded with this device which is capable of diagnosing even the most critical, obscure or technical injuries any humanoid entity is suffering in an easy to understand format that even a non-trained health professional can understand.<br><br>The health analyser is expected to go into full production as standard issue medical kit.
<b>*Inventory*</b><br><br>(1) Prototype Hardsuit<br><br>(1)Health Analyser<br><br>(1)Prototype Energy Gun<br><br>(1)Singularity Generation Disk<br><br><b>DO NOT REMOVE WITHOUT THE CAPTAIN AND RESEARCH DIRECTOR'S AUTHORISATION</b>
<b>*K14-Multiphase Energy Gun*</b><br><br>The K14 Prototype Energy Gun is the first Energy Rifle that has been successfully been able to not only hold a larger ammo charge than other gun models, but is capable of swapping between different energy projectile types on command with no incidents.<br><br>The weapon still suffers several drawbacks, its alternative, non laser fire mode, can only fire one round before exhausting the energy cell, the weapon also remains prohibitively expensive, nonetheless NT Market Research fully believe this weapon will form the backbone of our Energy weapon catalogue.<br><br>The K14 is expected to undergo revision to fix the ammo issues, the K15 is expected to replace the 'stun' setting with a 'disable' setting in an attempt to bypass the ammo issues.
<b>*Prototype Hardsuit*</b><br><br>The B01-RIG Hardsuit is a prototype powered exoskeleton. Based off of a recovered pre-void war era united Earth government powered military exosuit, the RIG Hardsuit is a breakthrough in Hardsuit technology, and is the first post-void war era Hardsuit that can be safely used by an operator.<br><br>The B01 however suffers a myriad of constraints. It is slow and bulky to move around, it lacks any significant armor plating against direct attacks and its internal heads up display is unfinished,  resulting in the user being unable to see long distances.<br><br>The B01 is unlikely to see any form of mass production, but will serve as a base for future Hardsuit developments.
<b>*Singularity Generator*</b><br><br>Modern power generation typically comes in two forms, a Fusion Generator or a Fission Generator. Fusion provides the best space to power ratio, and is typically seen on military or high security ships and stations, however Fission reactors require the usage of expensive, and rare, materials in its construction.. Fission generators are massive and bulky, and require a large reserve of uranium to power, however they are extremely cheap to operate and oft need little maintenance once operational.<br><br>The Singularity aims to alter this, a functional Singularity is essentially a controlled Black Hole, a Black Hole that generates far more power than Fusion or Fission generators can ever hope to produce.

<b>A list of Guardian Types</b><br>

 <br>
 <b>Assassin</b>: Does medium damage and takes full damage, but can enter stealth, causing its next attack to do massive damage and ignore armor. However, it becomes briefly unable to recall after attacking from stealth.<br>
 <br>
 <b>Chaos</b>: Ignites enemies on touch and causes them to hallucinate all nearby people as the guardian. Automatically extinguishes the user if they catch on fire.<br>
 <br>
 <b>Charger</b>: Moves extremely fast, does medium damage on attack, and can charge at targets, damaging the first target hit and forcing them to drop any items they are holding.<br>
 <br>
 <b>Dexterous</b>: Does low damage on attack, but is capable of holding items and storing a single item within it. It will drop items held in its hands when it recalls, but it will retain the stored item.<br>
 <br>
 <b>Explosive</b>: High damage resist and medium power attack that may explosively teleport targets. Can turn any object, including objects too large to pick up, into a bomb, dealing explosive damage to the next person to touch it. The object will return to normal after the trap is triggered or after a delay.<br>
 <br>
 <b>Lightning</b>: Attacks apply lightning chains to targets. Has a lightning chain to the user. Lightning chains shock everything near them, doing constant damage.<br>
 <br>
 <b>Protector</b>: Causes you to teleport to it when out of range, unlike other parasites. Has two modes; Combat, where it does and takes medium damage, and Protection, where it does and takes almost no damage but moves slightly slower.<br>
 <br>
 <b>Ranged</b>: Has two modes. Ranged; which fires a constant stream of weak, armor-ignoring projectiles. Scout; Cannot attack, but can move through walls and is quite hard to see. Can lay surveillance snares, which alert it when crossed, in either mode.<br>
 <br>
 <b>Standard</b>: Devastating close combat attacks and high damage resist. Can smash through weak walls.<br>

<b>DON'T PANIC.</b><br><br>Here's a quick primer on what you should know here.<ol><li>You're in a place called Reebe right now. The crew can't get here normally.</li><li>In the north is your base camp, with supplies, consoles, and the Ark. In the south is an inaccessible area that the crew can walk between once they arrive (more on that later.) Everything between that space is an open area.</li><li>Your job as a servant is to build fortifications and defenses to protect the Ark and your base once the Ark activates. You can do this however you like, but work with your allies and coordinate your efforts.</li><li>Once the Ark activates, the station will be alerted. Portals to Reebe will open up in nearly every room. When they take these portals, the crewmembers will arrive in the area that you can't access, but can get through it freely - whereas you can't. Treat this as the "spawn" of the crew and defend it accordingly.</li></ol><hr>Here is the layout of Reebe, from left to right:<ul><li><b>Dressing Room:</b> Contains clothing, a dresser, and a mirror. There are spare slabs and absconders here.</li><li><b>Listening Station:</b> Contains intercoms, a telecomms relay, and a list of frequencies.</li><li><b>Ark Chamber:</b> Houses the Ark.</li><li><b>Observation Room:</b> Contains five camera observers. These can be used to watch the station through its cameras, as well as to teleport down to most areas. To do this, use the Warp action while hovering over the tile you want to warp to.</li><li><b>Infirmary:</b> Contains sleepers and basic medical supplies for superficial wounds. The sleepers can consume Vitality to heal any occupants. This room is generally more useful during the preparation phase; when defending the Ark, scripture is more useful.</li></ul><hr><h2>Things that have changed:</h2><ul>CLOCKCULTCHANGELOG</ul><hr><b>Good luck!</b>

<b>From: XCC-P5831 Management Office</b><br><b>To: Rolf Ingram, XCC-P5831 Quartermaster</b><br>Hey, Rolf, once you pack that gateway into the ferry hangar, <i>make absolutely sure</i> to deactivate it! As you may know, SS13 has recently got its network up and running, which means that until we get this gate shipped off to the next colonization staging area, they'll be able to hop straight in here if its hooked up on our end.<br>Obviously, that's something I'd very much rather avoid. Our forensics and medical teams never did figure out what happened that last time... and I can't wrap my head around it myself.

<b>Labor Camp Facility Operation Guide</b><br><br>Hello there, proud operator of an NT-Sec Prisoner Rehabilitation Center.  A solution to rising crime rates and falling productivity, these facilities are specifically designed for the safe, productive imprisonment of your most dangerous criminals.  <br><br>To press a long-term prisoner into the service of the station, replace his equipment with prisoners' garb at one of the prison lockers, as per normal operating procedure.  Before assigning a prisoner his ID, insert the ID into a prisoner management console and assign the prisoner a quota, based on the severity of his crime.  <br>A single sheet of most materials produces five points for the prisoner, and points can be expected to be produced at a rate of about 100 per minute, though punishments as severe as forced labor should be reserved for serious crimes of sentences not less than five minutes long.<br>Once you have prepared the prisoner, place him in the secure northern half of the labor shuttle, and send him to the station.  Once he meets his quota by feeding sheets to the stacker, he will be allowed to return to the station, and will be able to open the secure door to the prisoner release area.<br><br>In the case of dangerous prisoners, surveillance may be needed. To that end, there is a prisoner monitoring room on the mining station, equipped with a remote flasher and a lockdown button.  The mine itself is patrolled by a securibot, so the nearby security records console can also be used to secure hostile prisoners on the mine.

<b>Welcome to the Nanotrasen Gateway project...</b><br>Congratulations! If you're reading this, you and your superiors have decided that you're ready to commit to a life spent colonising the rolling hills of far away worlds. You must be ready for a lifetime of adventure, a little bit of hard work, and an award winning dental plan- but that's not all the Nanotrasen Gateway project has to offer.<br><br>Because we care about you, we feel it is only fair to make sure you know the risks before you commit to joining the Nanotrasen Gateway project. All away destinations have been fully scanned by a Nanotrasen expeditionary team, and are certified to be 100% safe. We've even left a case of space beer along with the basic materials you'll need to expand Nanotrasen's operational area and start your new life.<br><br><b>Gateway Operation Basics</b><br>All Nanotrasen approved Gateways operate on the same basic principals. They operate off area equipment power as you would expect, and without this supply, it cannot safely function, causinng it to reject all attempts at operation.<br><br>Once it is correctly setup, and once it has enough power to operate, the Gateway will begin searching for an output location. The amount of time this takes is variable, but the Gateway interface will give you an estimate accurate to the minute. Power loss will not interrupt the searching process. Influenza will not interrupt the searching process. Temporal anomalies may cause the estimate to be inaccurate, but will not interrupt the searching process.<br><br> <b>Life On The Other Side</b><br>Once you have traversed the Gateway, you may experience some disorientation. Do not panic. This is a normal side effect of travelling vast distances in a short period of time. You should survey the immediate area, and attempt to locate your complimentary case of space beer. Our expeditionary teams have ensured the complete safety of all away locations, but in a small number of cases, the Gateway they have established may not be immediately obvious. Do not panic if you cannot locate the return Gateway. Begin colonisation of the destination. <br><br><b>A New World</b><br>As a participant in the Nanotrasen Gateway Project, you will be on the frontiers of space. Though complete safety is assured, participants are advised to prepare for inhospitable environs.
<b>While your infection strain is undetectable by scanners, any other infectees will show up on medical equipment.</b>

This is completely silent and safe to use, and failing will reset the cooldown. As you assimilate the crew, you will gain more powers to use. Most are silent and won't help you in a fight, but grant you great power over your vessels. Hover your mouse over a power's action icon for an extended description on what it does.

<center>Some of the miners have gone to laying some mine traps among the lower levels of the mine to keep the monsters at bay.  This probably isn't the smartest idea in a cavern like this but the boys seem to get a chuckle out of every distant blast they hear go off, so I guess it works </center>
<center>We were supposed to get a shipment of these special laser rifles and a couple 'nades to help combat the wildlife down here, but it's been weeks since we last heard from the caravan carrying the shit down here. At this point we can only assume they fell victim to one of the monster nests or the dumbasses managed to trip into the lava. So much for that shipment, I guess.</center>

<font color=#BE8700 size=3>The Ancient Scripture</font><br><br>
<font color=#BE8700><b>A Note on Geis:</b></font> There are several ways to convert humans and silicons. However, the most important tool to making them work is <b>Geis</b>, a Driver-tier scripture. Using it whispers an invocation very quickly and charges your slab with power. In addition to <i>making the slab visible in your hand,</i> you can now use it on a target within melee range to bind and mute them. It is by far your most reliable tool for capturing potential converts and targets, though it is incredibly obvious. In addition, you are unable to take any actions other than moving while your target is bound. The binding will last for 25 seconds and mute for about 13 seconds, though allies can use Geis to refresh these effects.<br><br>
<font color=#BE8700><b>Accession:</b></font> Identical to the Sigil of Submission, but doesn't disappear on use. It can also convert a single mindshielded target, but will disappear after doing this.<br>
<font color=#BE8700><b>Ark:</b></font> The cult's win condition, a huge structure that needs to be defended.<br><br>
<font color=#BE8700><b>CV:</b></font> Construction Value. All clockwork structures, floors, and walls increase this number.<br>
<font color=#BE8700><b>Cache:</b></font> A <i>Tinkerer's Cache</i>, which is a structure that stores and creates components.<br>
<font color=#BE8700><b>Converting Humans:</b></font> For obvious reasons, humans are the most common conversion target. Because every crew member is different, and may be armed with different equipment, you should take precautions to ensure that they aren't able to resist. If able, removing a headset is essential, as is restraining them through handcuffs, cable ties, or other restraints. Some crew, like security, are also implanted with mindshield implants; these will prevent conversion and must be surgically removed before they are an eligible convert. <i>Note:</i> The captain is <i>never</i> an eligible convert and should instead be killed or imprisoned. If security begins administering mindshield implants, this will greatly inhibit conversion. Also note that mindshield implants can be broken by a sigil of accession automatically, but the sigil will disappear.<br><br>
<font color=#BE8700><b>Converting Silicons:</b></font> Due to their robotic nature, silicons are generally more predictable than humans in terms of conversion. However, they are also much, much harder to subdue, especially cyborgs. The easiest way to convert a cyborg is by using Geis to restrain them, then dragging them to a sigil of submission. If you stack a sigil of transgression and a sigil of submission, a crossing cyborg will be stunned and helpless to escape before they are converted.<br><br>
<font color=#BE8700><b>Converting the Station:</b></font> Converted objects all serve a purpose and are important to the cult's success. To convert objects, a Servant needs to use a <b>replica fabricator,</b> a handheld tool that uses power to replace objects with clockwork versions. Different clockwork objects have different effects and are often crucial. The most noteworthy are <b>clockwork walls,</b> which automatically "link" to any nearby Tinkerer's Caches, causing them to <b>slowly generate components.</b> This is incredibly useful for obvious reasons, and creating a clockwork wall near every Tinkerer's Cache should be prioritized. Clockwork floors will slowly heal any toxin damage suffered by Servants standing on them, and clockwork airlocks can only be opened by Servants.<br><br>
<font color=#BE8700><b>Converting:</b></font> The two methods of conversion are the <b>sigil of submission</b>, whose purpose is to do so, and the <b>mania motor.</b> The sigil of submission is a sigil that, when stood on by a non-Servant for eight seconds, will convert that non-Servant. This is the only practical way to convert targets. Sigils of submission are cheap, early, and permanent! Make sure sigils of submission are placed only in bases or otherwise hidden spots, or with a sigil of transgression on them. The mania motor, however, is generally unreliable and unlocked later, only converting those who stand near it for an extended period.<br><br>
<font color=#BE8700><b>Daemon*:</b></font> A tinkerer's daemon, which quickly creates components.<br>
<font color=#BE8700><b>Fabricator:</b></font> A replica fabricator, which converts objects into clockwork versions.<br><br>
<font color=#BE8700><b>Geis:</b></font> An important scripture used to make normal crew and robots into Servants of Ratvar.<br>
<font color=#BE8700><b>Marauder:</b></font> A clockwork marauder, which is a powerful bodyguard that hides in its owner.<br><br>
<font color=#BE8700><b>Matrix:</b></font> Drains health from non-Servants, producing Vitality. Can heal and revive Servants.<br>
<font color=#BE8700><b>Motor*:</b></font> A mania motor, which serves as area-denial through negative effects and eventual conversion.<br>
<font color=#BE8700><b>Obelisk*:</b></font> A clockwork obelisk, which can broadcast large messages and allows limited teleportation.<br>
<font color=#BE8700><b>Prism*:</b></font> A prolonging prism, which delays the shuttle for two minutes at a huge power cost.<br><br>
<font color=#BE8700><b>Servant:</b></font> A person or robot who serves Ratvar. You are one of these.<br>
<font color=#BE8700><b>Slab:</b></font> A clockwork slab, a Servant's most important tool. You're holding one! Keep it safe and hidden.<br>
<font color=#BE8700><b>Spear:</b></font> A Ratvarian spear, which is a very powerful melee weapon that produces Vitality.<br>
<font color=#BE8700><b>Submission:</b></font> Converts the first non-Servant to stand on the sigil for seven seconds. Disappears on use.<br>
<font color=#BE8700><b>Transgression:</b></font> Stuns the first non-Servant to cross it for ten seconds and blinds others nearby. Disappears on use.<br>
<font color=#BE8700><b>Transmission:</b></font> Drains and stores power for clockwork structures. Feeding it brass sheets will create additional power.<br><br>
<font color=#BE8700><b>Visor:</b></font> A judicial visor, which is a pair of glasses that can smite an area for a brief stun and delayed explosion.<br>
<font color=#BE8700><b>Vitality:</b></font> Used for healing effects, produced by Ratvarian spear attacks and Vitality Matrices.<br>
<font color=#BE8700><b>Warden:</b></font> An ocular warden, which is a ranged turret that damages non-Servants that see it.<br>
<font color=#BE8700><b>Wraith Specs:</b></font> Wraith spectacles, which provide true sight (X-ray, night vision) but damage the wearer's eyes.<br>

<h1>Gravity Generator Instructions For Dummies</h1>
	<p>Surprisingly, gravity isn't that hard to make! All you have to do is inject deadly radioactive minerals into a ball of
	energy and you have yourself gravity! You can turn the machine on or off when required but you must remember that the generator
	will EMIT RADIATION when charging or discharging, you can tell it is charging or discharging by the noise it makes, so please WEAR PROTECTIVE CLOTHING.</p>
	<br>
	<h3>It blew up!</h3>
	<p>Don't panic! The gravity generator was designed to be easily repaired. If, somehow, the sturdy framework did not survive then
	please proceed to panic; otherwise follow these steps.</p><ol>
	<li>Secure the screws of the framework with a screwdriver.</li>
	<li>Mend the damaged framework with a welding tool.</li>
	<li>Add additional plasteel plating.</li>
	<li>Secure the additional plating with a wrench.</li></ol>

<h1>Welcome</h1><p>At greencorps we love the environment, and space. With this package you are able to help mother nature and produce energy without any usage of fossil fuel or plasma! Singularity energy is dangerous while solar energy is safe, which is why it's better. Now here is how you setup your own solar array.</p><p>You can make a solar panel by wrenching the solar assembly onto a cable node. Adding a glass panel, reinforced or regular glass will do, will finish the construction of your solar panel. It is that easy!</p><p>Now after setting up 19 more of these solar panels you will want to create a solar tracker to keep track of our mother nature's gift, the sun. These are the same steps as before except you insert the tracker equipment circuit into the assembly before performing the final step of adding the glass. You now have a tracker! Now the last step is to add a computer to calculate the sun's movements and to send commands to the solar panels to change direction with the sun. Setting up the solar computer is the same as setting up any computer, so you should have no trouble in doing that. You do need to put a wire node under the computer, and the wire needs to be connected to the tracker.</p><p>Congratulations, you should have a working solar array. If you are having trouble, here are some tips. Make sure all solar equipment are on a cable node, even the computer. You can always deconstruct your creations if you make a mistake.</p><p>That's all to it, be safe, be green!</p>

<h4>Day 1</h4>
	We are very excited to be part of the first crew of the SC Irmanda!<br>
	This ship is made to test an innovative FTL technology. I had some concerns at first, but the engineers assure me that it is safe and there is absolutely no risk of the external wings breaking off from the acceleration.<br>
	We've been tasked with testing the latest model of the Thinktronic Cloning Pod. We'll stay in dock for a week before launching, but we're going to get started right away. If the engine is as fast as they say, we might not have the time to run all the routine tests on the cloned subject!<br>
	<br>
	<h4>Day 2</h4>
	We cloned an unknown corpse that was given to us by the medical crew. The genetic replication is good enough to let the subject survive outside of the pod, but the cellular damage remains a concern for his long-term survival. For safety we will be keeping him in quarantine.<br>
	We left him some books, but clearly we were too optimistic about his mental faculties. His brain seems to suffer from the same cloning decay that was caused by the previous models. We will run further tests to see if there are improvements.<br>
	<h4>Day 4</h4>
	It seems we'll be launching even sooner than expected! Apparently the press is starting to lose interest, so we have to cut short the pre-flight checks and give them something to talk about. Hopefully this will end up with increased funding...<br>
	The crew has all been invited to the main hall, where we have seats for the initial FTL acceleration. Unfortunately the clone cannot leave the quarantine room without risking infection, so we will strap him into the bed and hope for the best. We can grow another clone if anything goes wrong, anyway.

<h4>Engineering Functions</h4>
<h4>First Week!</h4>
	First week on the new job. It's a secretarial position, but hey, whatever pays the bills. Plus it seems like some interesting stuff goes on here.<br>
	Doc says its best that I don't openly talk about his research with others, I guess he doesn't want it getting out or something. I've caught myself slipping a few times when talking to others, it's hard not to brag about something this cool!<br>
	I'm not really sure why I'm choosing to journal this. Doc seems to log everything. He says it's incase he discovers anything important.<br>
    I guess that's why I'm doing it too, I've always wanted to be a part of something important.<br>
    Here's to a new job and to becoming a part of something important!<br>
	<h4>Weird times...</h4>
	Things are starting to get a little strange around here. Just weeks after Doc's amazing breakthrough, weird visitors have began showing up unannounced, asking strange things about Doc's work.<br>
    I knew Doc wasn't a big fan of company, but even he seemed strangely unnerved when I told him about the visitors.<br>
    He said it's important that from here on out we keep tight security on everything, even other staff members.<br>
    He also said something about securing data, something about hexes. What's that mean? Some sort of curse? Doc never struck me as the magic type...<br>
    He often uses a lot of big sciencey words that I don't really understand, but I kinda dig it, it makes me feel like I'm witnessing something big.<br>
    I hope things go back to normal soon, but I guess that's the price you pay for being a part of something important.<br>
	<h4>Last day I guess?</h4>
	Things are officially starting to get too strange for me.<br>
    The visitors have been coming a lot more often, and they all seem increasingly aggressive and nosey. I'm starting to see why they made Doc so nervous, they're certainly starting to creep me out too.<br>
    Awhile ago Doc started having me keep the place on strict lockdown and requested I refuse entry to anyone else, including previous staff.<br>
    But the weirdest part?<br>
    I haven't seen Doc in days. It's not unusual for him to work continuously for long periods of time in the lab, but when I took a peak in their yesterday - he was nowhere to be seen! I didn't risk prying much further, Doc had a habit of leaving the defense systems on these last few weeks.<br>
    I'm thinking it might be time to call it quits. Can't work much without a boss, plus things are starting to get kind of shady. I wanted to be a part of something important, but you gotta know when to play it safe.<br>
    As my dad always said, "The smart get famous, but the wise survive..."<br>

<h4>General Functions</h4>
<h4>Getting Started</h4>
	Congratulations, you are testing the H-11 experimental cloning device!<br>
	Using the H-11 is almost as simple as brain surgery! Simply insert the target humanoid into the scanning chamber and select the clone option to initiate cloning!<br>
	<b>That's all there is to it!</b><br>
	<i>Notice, cloning system cannot scan inorganic life or small primates.  Scan may fail if subject has suffered extreme brain damage.</i><br>
	<p>The provided CLONEPOD SYSTEM will produce the desired clone.  Standard clone maturation times are roughly 90 seconds.
	The cloning pod may be unlocked early after initial maturation is complete.</p><br>
	<i>Please note that resulting clones will have a DEVELOPMENTAL DEFECT as a result of genetic drift. We hope to reduce this through further testing.<br>
	Clones may also experience memory loss and radical changes in personality as a result of the cloning process.</i><br>
	<br>
	<font size=1>This technology produced under license from Thinktronic Systems, LTD.</font>
<h4>Getting Started</h4>
	Congratulations, your station has purchased the H-87 industrial cloning device!<br>
	Using the H-87 is almost as simple as brain surgery! Simply insert the target humanoid into the scanning chamber and select the scan option to create a new profile!<br>
	<b>That's all there is to it!</b><br>
	<i>Notice, cloning system cannot scan inorganic life or small primates.  Scan may fail if subject has suffered extreme brain damage.</i><br>
	<p>Clone profiles may be viewed through the profiles menu. Scanning implants a complementary HEALTH MONITOR IMPLANT into the subject, which may be viewed from each profile.
	Profile Deletion has been restricted to [Station Head] level access.</p>
	<h4>Cloning from a profile</h4>
	Cloning is as simple as pressing the CLONE option at the bottom of the desired profile.<br>
	Per your company's EMPLOYEE PRIVACY RIGHTS agreement, the H-87 has been blocked from cloning crewmembers while they are still alive.<br>
	<br>
	<p>The provided CLONEPOD SYSTEM will produce the desired clone.  Standard clone maturation times (With SPEEDCLONE technology) are roughly 90 seconds.
	The cloning pod may be unlocked early with any [Medical Researcher] ID after initial maturation is complete.</p><br>
	<i>Please note that resulting clones may have a small DEVELOPMENTAL DEFECT as a result of genetic drift.</i><br>
	<h4>Profile Management</h4>
	<p>The H-87 (as well as your station's standard genetics machine) can accept STANDARD DATA DISKETTES.
	These diskettes are used to transfer genetic information between machines and profiles.
	A load/save dialog will become available in each profile if a disk is inserted.</p><br>
	<i>A good diskette is a great way to counter aforementioned genetic drift!</i><br>

			Nuclear Explosives 101:<br>
			Hello and thank you for choosing the Syndicate for your nuclear information needs.<br>
			Today's crash course will deal with the operation of a Fusion Class Nanotrasen made Nuclear Device.<br>
			First and foremost, DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING UNTIL THE BOMB IS IN PLACE.<br>
			Pressing any button on the compacted bomb will cause it to extend and bolt itself into place.<br>
			If this is done to unbolt it one must completely log in which at this time may not be possible.<br>
			To make the nuclear device functional:<br>
			<li>Place the nuclear device in the designated detonation zone.</li>
			<li>Extend and anchor the nuclear device from its interface.</li>
			<li>Insert the nuclear authorisation disk into slot.</li>
			<li>Type numeric authorisation code into the keypad. This should have been provided. Note: If you make a mistake press R to reset the device.
			<li>Press the E button to log onto the device.</li>
			You now have activated the device. To deactivate the buttons at anytime for example when you've already prepped the bomb for detonation	remove the auth disk OR press the R on the keypad.<br>
			Now the bomb CAN ONLY be detonated using the timer. Manual detonation is not an option.<br>
			Note: Nanotrasen is a pain in the neck.<br>
			Toggle off the SAFETY.<br>
			Note: You wouldn't believe how many Syndicate Operatives with doctorates have forgotten this step.<br>
			So use the - - and + + to set a det time between 5 seconds and 10 minutes.<br>
			Then press the timer toggle button to start the countdown.<br>
			Now remove the auth. disk so that the buttons deactivate.<br>
			Note: THE BOMB IS STILL SET AND WILL DETONATE<br>
			Now before you remove the disk if you need to move the bomb you can:<br>
			Toggle off the anchor, move it, and re-anchor.<br><br>
			Good luck. Remember the order:<br>
			<b>Disk, Code, Safety, Timer, Disk, RUN!</b><br>
			Intelligence Analysts believe that normal Nanotrasen procedure is for the Captain to secure the nuclear authorisation disk.<br>
			Good luck!

<i>I swear to fulfill, to the best of my ability and judgment, this covenant:
	<br>
	I will respect the hard-won scientific gains of those physicians in whose steps I walk,
	and gladly share such knowledge as is mine with those who are to follow.
	<br>
	I will apply, for the benefit of the sick, all measures that are required,
	avoiding those twin traps of overtreatment and therapeutic nihilism.
	<br>
	I will remember that there is art to medicine as well as science,
	and that warmth, sympathy, and understanding may outweigh the surgeon's knife or the chemist's drug.
	<br>
	I will not be ashamed to say "I know not,"
	nor will I fail to call in my colleagues when the skills of another are needed for a patient's recovery.
	<br>
	I will respect the privacy of my patients, for their problems are not disclosed to me that the world may know. Most especially must I tread with care in matters of life and death.
	If it is given me to save a life, all thanks. But it may also be within my power to take a life;
	this awesome responsibility must be faced with great humbleness and awareness of my own frailty. Above all, I must not play at God.
	<br>
	I will remember that I do not treat a fever chart, a cancerous growth, but a sick human being, whose illness may affect the person's family and economic stability.
	My responsibility includes these related problems, if I am to care adequately for the sick.
	<br>
	I will prevent disease whenever I can, for prevention is preferable to cure.
	<br>
	I will remember that I remain a member of society, with special obligations to all my fellow human beings,
	those sound of mind and body as well as the infirm.
	<br>
	If I do not violate this oath, may I enjoy life and art, respected while I live and remembered with affection thereafter.
	May I always act so as to preserve the finest traditions of my calling and may I long experience the joy of healing those who seek my help.

A highly specialized weapon, the Blast Cannon is actually relatively simple. It contains an attachment for a tank transfer valve mounted to an angled pipe specially constructed withstand extreme pressure and temperatures, and has a mechanical trigger for triggering the transfer valve. Essentially, it turns the explosive force of a bomb into a narrow-angle blast wave "projectile". Aspiring scientists may find this highly useful, as forcing the pressure shockwave into a narrow angle seems to be able to bypass whatever quirk of physics disallows explosive ranges above a certain distance, allowing for the device to use the theoretical yield of a transfer valve bomb, instead of the factual yield.

Agent cards prevent artificial intelligences from tracking the wearer, and can copy access from other identification cards. The access is cumulative, so scanning one card does not erase the access gained from another. In addition, they can be forged to display a new assignment and name. This can be done an unlimited amount of times. Some Syndicate areas and devices can only be accessed with these cards.

Alright, listen up. If you're reading this, I'm either taking a shit or I've been recalled back to Command. Either way, you'll need to know how to restore power. We've stolen this stuff from Nanotrasen, so all the equipment is jury-rigged. We have generators that work on both plasma and uranium, about 50 sheets should power the outpost for quite a while. If the generators aren't working, which is very likely, take the power cell on the desk and put it into the APC in the hallway. That should get the place running, at least for a little while.
Also known as Virginity Protectors.
Also known as sodium hydroxide. As a profession making this is somewhat underwhelming.

Although more specific threats are commonplace, you should always remain vigilant for Syndicate agents aboard your station. Syndicate communications have implied that many Nanotrasen employees are Syndicate agents with hidden memories that may be activated at a moment's notice, so it's possible that these agents might not even know their positions.
Although powerful, the warden is very fragile and should optimally be placed behind barricades.
Although this is a good rule of thumb, their effects become much more nuanced when used together. For instance, a turret might have both belligerent eyes and vanguard cogwheels as construction requirements, because it defends its allies by harming its enemies.<br><br>
Although this stasis pod looks medicinal, it seems as though it's meant to preserve something for a very long time.

As I see it, yes
As a <span class='danger'>Bananium Golem</span>, you are made for pranking. Your body emits natural honks, and you can barely even hurt people when punching them. Your skin also bleeds banana peels when damaged.
As a <span class='danger'>Bluespace Golem</span>, you are spatially unstable: You will teleport when hit, and you can teleport manually at a long distance.
As a <span class='danger'>Cloth Golem</span>, you are able to reform yourself after death, provided your remains aren't burned or destroyed. You are, of course, very flammable. Being made of cloth, your body is magic resistant and faster than that of other golems, but weaker and less resilient.
As a <span class='danger'>Diamond Golem</span>, you are more resistant than the average golem.
As a <span class='danger'>Glass Golem</span>, you reflect lasers and energy weapons, and are very resistant to burn damage. However, you are extremely vulnerable to brute damage. On death, you'll shatter beyond any hope of recovery.
As a <span class='danger'>Gold Golem</span>, you are faster but less resistant than the average golem.
As a <span class='danger'>Plasma Golem</span>, you burn easily. Be careful, if you get hot enough while burning, you'll blow up!
As a <span class='danger'>Plasteel Golem</span>, you are slower, but harder to stun, and hit very hard when punching.
As a <span class='danger'>Plastic Golem</span>, you are capable of ventcrawling and passing through plastic flaps as long as you are naked.
As a <span class='danger'>Plastitanium Golem</span>, you are immune to both ash storms and lava, and slightly more resistant to burn damage.
As a <span class='danger'>Runic Golem</span>, you possess eldritch powers granted by the Elder Goddess Nar'Sie.
As a <span class='danger'>Sand Golem</span>, you are immune to physical bullets and take very little brute damage, but are extremely vulnerable to burn damage and energy weapons. You will also turn to sand when dying, preventing any form of recovery.
As a <span class='danger'>Silver Golem</span>, your attacks have a higher chance of stunning. Being made of silver, your body is immune to most types of magic.
As a <span class='danger'>Titanium Golem</span>, you are immune to ash storms, and slightly more resistant to burn damage.
As a <span class='danger'>Wooden Golem</span>, you have plant-like traits: you take damage from extreme temperatures, can be set on fire, and have lower armor than a normal golem. You regenerate when in the light and wither in the darkness.
As a Servant of Ratvar, the tools you are given focus around building and maintaining bases and outposts. A great deal of your power comes from stationary structures, and without constructing a base somewhere, it's essentially impossible to succeed. Finding a good spot to build a base can be difficult, and it's recommended that you choose an area in low-traffic part of the station (such as the auxiliary base). Make sure to disconnect any cameras in the area beforehand.<br><br>
As a cyborg, you must obey your silicon laws and master AI above all else. Your objectives will consider you to be dead.
As an <span class='danger'>Adamantine Golem</span>, you possess special vocal cords allowing you to "resonate" messages to all golems. Your unique mineral makeup makes you immune to most types of magic.
As an <span class='danger'>Alloy Golem</span>, you are made of advanced alien materials: you are faster and regenerate over time. You are, however, only able to be heard by other alloy golems.
As an <span class='danger'>Iron Golem</span>, you don't have any special traits.
As an <span class='danger'>Uranium Golem</span>, you emit radiation pulses every once in a while. It won't harm fellow golems, but organic lifeforms will be affected.
As elegant as a dancing cactus.
As far as you can remember, you've always been afraid of the dark. While in the dark without a light source, you instinctually act careful, and constantly feel a sense of dread.

Assume the best, prepare for the worst. Generally, you should do so by digging a three man heavily fortified bunker into a giant unused asteroid. Then make it self sufficient, mask any evidence of construction, hook it covertly into the telecommunications network and hope for the best.

Because eating bear wasn't manly enough.
Because jello wasn't offensive enough to vegans.
Because of how complex being a Servant is, it isn't possible to fit much information into this section. It's highly recommended that you read the <b>Components</b> and <b>Scripture</b> sections next. Not knowing how these two systems work will cripple both you and your fellows, and lead to a frustrating experience for everyone.<br><br>
Because seven shots are all you need.
Because sometimes quantity is quality. Contains 10 C-4 plastic explosives.
Because the Servants of Ratvar are a cult, the main method to gain more power is to "enlighten" normal crew into new Servants. When a crewmember is converted, they become a full-fledged Servant, ready and willing to serve the cause of Ratvar. It should also be noted that <i>silicon crew, such as cyborgs and the AI, can be converted just like normal crew</i> and will gain special abilities; this is covered later. This section will also cover converting the station's structure itself; walls, floors, windows, tables, and other objects can all be converted into clockwork versions, and serve an important purpose.<br><br>
Because they are the only ones who will drink 100 proof cinnamon schnapps.
Because you really needed another excuse to punch your crewmates.

Bluespace monitors near your sector have detected a continuous stream of patterned fluctuations since the station was completed. It is most probable that a powerful entity from a very far distance away is using to the station as a vector to cross that distance through bluespace. The theoretical power required for this would be monumental, and if the entity is hostile, it would need to rely on a single central power source - disrupting or destroying that power source would be the best way to prevent said entity from causing harm to company personnel or property.<br><br>Keep a sharp on any crew that appear to be oddly-dressed or using what appear to be magical powers, as these crew may be defectors working for this entity and utilizing highly-advanced technology to cross the great distance at will. If they should turn out to be a credible threat, the task falls on you and your crew to dispatch it in a timely manner.
Bluespace technology packed into a roughly egg-shaped device, used to store nonhuman creatures. Can't catch them all, though - it only fits one.

Converting AIs is very often the hardest task of the cult, and has been the downfall of countless successful Servants. Their omnipresence across the station, coupled with their secure location and ability to lock themselves securely, makes them a powerful target. However, once the AI itself is reached, it is usually completely helpless to resist its own conversion. A very common tactic is to take advantage of a converted cyborg to rush the AI before it is able to react.<br><br>

DEAR DIARY: So we was doing our typical route when the captain says we've been picking up weird signals on some backwater planet. Madsen wanted to stay on course but he ain't the captain, so we went out of the way to check it out. There was lots of rocks on the way, but we got to the planet fine. Found a big fancy camp with nobody around and this big metal donut thing with NT stamps all over it right in the middle. Case of beer too. Captain reckons we can pass it off to some buyer in the Syndicate. Ingram says it's bad luck and that someone is going to come look for it but it sounds like better money than selling bad meat to jerky companies.

Direction
Directions for use: Requires two people, one to pull each end.
Directions:<br><i>First you'll want to make sure there is a target stake in the center of the magnetic platform. Next, take an aluminium target from the crates back there and slip it into the stake. Make sure it clicks! Next, there should be a control console mounted on the wall somewhere in the room.<br><br> This control console dictates the behaviors of the magnetic platform, which can move your firing target around to simulate real-world combat situations. From here, you can turn off the magnets or adjust their electromagnetic levels and magnetic fields. The electricity level dictates the strength of the pull - you will usually want this to be the same value as the speed. The magnetic field level dictates how far the magnetic pull reaches.<br><br>Speed and path are the next two settings. Speed is associated with how fast the machine loops through the designated path. Paths dictate where the magnetic field will be centered at what times. There should be a pre-fabricated path input already. You can enable moving to observe how the path affects the way the stake moves. To script your own path, look at the following key:</i><br><br>N: North<br>S: South<br>E: East<br>W: West<br>C: Center<br>R: Random (results may vary)<br>; or &: separators. They are not necessary but can make the path string better visible.

Entry Name
Entry One - 27/05/2554:<br>I just arrived, and already I hate my job. I'm stuck on this shithole of an outpost, trying to avoid these damn eggheads running all over the place preparing for god knows what. There's no crimes to stop, no syndies to kill, and I'm not even allowed to beat the fuckin' assistant senseless! They said I was transferred from Space Station 13 for 'good behavior', but this feels more like a punishment than a reward. All I know is that if I don't get some action soon, I'm going to go insane.<br><br>Entry Two - 03/06/2554:<br>Okay, so get this: we got a fuckin' deathsquad coming in today! I thought the day I saw one of them would be the day my employment was 'terminated', if you get my drift. They're escorting some sort of weird alien creature for the eggheads to study. I heard one of the docs telling the chef that this thing killed a whole security force before it was captured. I sure as hell hope that I don't have to fight it.<br><br>Entry Three - 08/06/2554:<br>My first real bit of 'action' today, if you could call it that. Crazy Ivan got in a fight with Kuester today about his Booze-O-Mat. Apparently one of the crewmembers had stolen a couple bottles of booze from the machine after Ivan disabled the ID lock. Tell you the truth, I don't blame the thief. Everyone is going a little stir-crazy in here, and the bartender is being damn stingy with the alcohol. Either way, once they started to pick a fight, I had to take them down. It's a damn shame that we don't have a brig, though. I had to lock Ivan in a fuckin' freezer, for god's sake. Let's hope that we can keep our sanity together, at least for a while.<br><br>Entry Four - 10/06/2554:<br>Jesus fucking Christ riding on a motorbike. These things the scientists are studying are terrifying! Fucking great huge purple bug things as tall as the ceiling, with blades for arms and drooling at the mouth. I don't think my taser will do jack shit against these damn things, but the eggheads say that they're safely contained. If they do, I have a feeling that it's only a matter of time before we're all screwed. These bastards look like walking death.<br><br>Entry Five - 18/06/2554:<br>Finally caught who stole the booze from Kuester. It was that fuckin' loser assistant Steve! He was in the dorms, chugging his worries away. I took one of the bottles back to the barkeep, but no one has to know about this second one. I think I'm gonna enjoy this while watching tomorrow's Thunderdome match.<br><br>Entry Six - 19/06/2554:<br>Oh, great. The chef is still sleeping, so we get Ivan's gruel for breakfast today. I overheard Sano and Douglas saying something about the aliens being restless, so we might get some action today. As long as it happens after the big game, I'm fine with it. I still got one beer to drink before I'm ready to die.

Even now a light shines through the cracks.
Even once an AI is converted, care must be taken to ensure that it remains hidden. Not only does the AI's core become brassy and thus obvious to an outside observer, but <i>the AI loses the ability to speak in anything but Ratvarian.</i> For this reason, it has to remain completely silent over common radio channels if stealth is at all a priority. This is suspicious and will rapidly lead to the crew checking on it, which usually results in the cult's outing. It is, however, necessary to convert all AIs present on the station before the Ark becomes invokable, so this must be done at some point.<br><br>

Gravity has ceased affecting you, and you're floating around aimlessly. You'll need something large and heavy, like a wall or lattice, to push yourself off if you want to move. A jetpack would enable free range of motion. A pair of magboots would let you walk around normally on the floor. Barring those, you can throw things, use a fire extinguisher, or shoot a gun to move around via Newton's 3rd Law of Motion.

I am the law!
I am the night!
I am, the LAW!
I am... vanquished. My people will remem...ber...meeee.
I bet you love stuff made out of plump helmets!
I call toxins.
I can go through the wall! Neat.
I can see forever!
I can't get to the next page, it's stuck t- I'm good, it just turned to the next page on it's own.
I can't look away from the book!
I can't mo Oh, i'm fine...
I can't read this page, but somehow I feel like I learned something from it...
I can't see my hand...!
I come over, maybe I give you a pizza, maybe I break off your arm.
I could probably combine this with some other martial arts!
I didn't even know magic needed ammo...
I do say so myself chap.
I don't mean to sound corny...
I don't think I'll be working with superfluids...
I don't think anyone will be happy when I cast this spell...
I don't think this would combine with other martial arts...
I dunno about you guys, but IDs and PDAs being separate is clunky as fuck. Maybe we should merge them into a chip in our arms? That way they can't be stolen easily.
I explored the galaxy and all I got was this lousy T-shirt!
I feel ALIVE!
I feel bad for the heartless bastard who lost this.
I guess someone didn't like it.
I hope nobody asks me for a bloody cup o' tea...;Alcohol is humanity's friend. Would you abandon a friend?;Quite delighted to serve you!;Is nobody thirsty on this station?
I hope you're wearing eye protection.
I hope you've got insurance.
I just can't get EI NATH of you.
I just need to focus on one item...
I love you like Ian loves the HoP.
I mean, you don't /have/ to seek bling water. I just think you should.
I must be the CMO, 'cause I saw you on my CUTE sensors.
I must be tripping on BZ, because I saw an angel walk by.
I must pierce armor for maximum damage...
I must prove myself worthy of this power...
I must prove myself worthy to the masters of the sleeping carp...
I promise this doesn't give you syndicate goodies!
I say blue-mah-to, you say blue-mae-to.
I say to-mah-to, you say tom-mae-to.
I say to-mah-to, you say tom-mae-to... OH GOD IT'S EATING MY LEGS!!
I see you!
I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I,
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.
I swear to fulfill, to the best of my ability and judgment, this covenant:
I think I just burned my hand...
I think this is hurting the spine of the book...
I told you to shake it, no stirring.
I uh... I'm not really sure what this does. Wanna buy it?
I want immortality.
I want the station to disappear
I want to be rich
I want to rule the world
I want you more than an assistant wants insulated gloves.
I was sleeping, thanks a lot.
I will apply, for the benefit of the sick, all measures that are required, avoiding those twin traps of overtreatment and therapeutic nihilism.
I will give unto him that is munchies of the fountain of the cravings of life, freely.
I will notify ÿ when the round ends.
I will remember that I remain a member of society, with special obligations to all my fellow human beings, those sound of mind and body as well as the infirm.
I wish science could make me a bag of holding you.
I wish this was soup.
I wonder how much longer they will accept my empty reports. They will cancel the case soon without results. When the pickup comes, I will tell them I have lost faith in our cause, and beg them to consider a diplomatic solution. How many nuclear teams have been dispatched with those nukes? I must try and prevent more from ever being sent. If they will not listen to reason, I will detonate the warehouse myself. Maybe some day in the immediate future, space will be peaceful, though I don't intend to live to see it. And that is why I write this down- it is my sacrifice that stabilized your worlds, traveller. Spare a thought for me, and please attempt to prevent nuclear proliferation, should it ever rear its ugly head again. -DonkCo Operative #451
I wonder if I should hold?
I wouldn't eat this if I were you.
I wwwaaannntt tttoo dddiiieeee...
I'd risk the wrath of the gods to bwoink you.
I'm FLYING through these pages!
I'm Sure
I'm a clockwork cultist. Or zl inyragvar.
I'm a fucking badass and everyone around me knows it. Just look at them; they're all fucking shaking at the mere thought of me around.
I'm a little busy right now, Calhoun.
I'm a nuke op, and my pinpointer leads to your heart.
I'm gonna need some good gear to stop myself from burning to death...
I'm just here for the gasoline.
I'm losing control of the situation!!
I'm manually blinking, damn you book...
I'm no scientist, but judging from the design and components, it seems to be some kind of teleporter. This thing is gonna be worth a lot of cash to the right man. The boys are excited, as they have every right to be, and I've let them crack into that case of beer we got. I normally wouldn't allow such a thing, but this is a time for celebration! It's not like a couple drinks will hurt anything.
I'm not a changeling, but you make my proboscis extend.
I'm not a highlander, but there can only be one for me.
I'm sorry to break your immersion. This shit's bugged. Report this bug to Agouri, polyxenitopalidou@gmail.com
I'm super generic!
I'm thinking we should roll out a git repository for our research under the AGPLv3 license so that we can share it among the other stations freely.
I, Victor Belyakov, do hereby leave my _-

If I do not violate this oath, may I enjoy life and art, respected while I live and remembered with affection thereafter. May I always act so as to preserve the finest traditions of my calling and may I long experience the joy of healing those who seek my help.
If I was a security officer, I'd brig you all shift.
If I were an alien, would you let me hug you?
If I were the warden I'd always let you into my armory.
If a patient is in critical condition, rapidly heals all damage types as well as regulating oxygen in the body. Excellent for stabilizing wounded patients.
If anyone finds this, please, don't let my kids know I died a coward..
If clad in funeral garments, this devil will be unable to resurrect.  Should the clothes not fit, lay them gently on top of the devil's corpse.
If left untreated death will occur.
If left untreated subject will regurgitate bees.
If left untreated subject will regurgitate butterflies.
If left untreated the subject will become very weak, and may vomit often.
If left untreated the subject will burn to death for being a heretic.
If left untreated the subject will contract the flu.
If left untreated the subject will die!
If left untreated the subject will feel quite unwell.
If left untreated the subject will probably drive others to insanity.
If left untreated the subject will slow, as if partly frozen.
If no water is available, you may substitute tears.
If somebody looks at this while it's below your waist, you get to bop them.
If the crew can solve the puzzle, they will wake the wabbajack statue. It will likely not end well. There's a reason it's boarded up. Maybe they should have just left it alone.
If the equipment breaks there should be enough spare parts in our engineering storage near the north east solar array.
If the light stuff just won't do it.
If this candy corn were any harder Security would confiscate it for being a potential shiv.
If this is your first time being a Servant, relax. It's very much possible that you'll fail, but it's impossible to learn without making mistakes. For the time being, use the Hierophant Network button in the top left-hand corner of your screen to try and get in touch with your fellow Servants; ignore the others for now. This button will let you send messages across space and time to all other Servants. This makes it great for coordinating, and you should use it often! <i>Note:</i> Using this will cause you to whisper your message aloud, so doing so in a public place is very suspicious and you should try to restrict it to private use.<br><br>
If used in touch-based applications, immediately restores bruising as well as restoring more over time. If ingested through other means, deals minor toxin damage.
If used in touch-based applications, immediately restores burn wounds as well as restoring more over time. If ingested through other means, deals minor toxin damage.
If we are on fire, the healing effect will not function. Does not regrow limbs or restore lost blood. Functions while unconscious.
If we find a human mad enough to support our cause, this can be a helpful tool to stay in touch.
If you are not under attack, you must always respond to your true name.
If you aren't willing or don't have the time to read through every section, you can still help your teammates! Ask if they've set up a base. If they have, head there and ask however you can help; chances are there's always something. If not, it's your job as a Servant to get one up and running! Try to find a secluded, low-traffic area, like the auxiliary base or somewhere deep in maintenance. You'll want to go into the Drivers section of the slab and look for <i>Tinkerer's Cache.</i> Find a nice spot and create one. This serves as a storage for <i>components,</i> the cult's primary resource. (Your slab's probably produced a few by now.) By attacking that cache with this slab, you'll offload all your components into it, and all Servants will be able to use those components from any distance - all Tinkerer's Caches are linked!<br><br>
If you can see this description the code for the deep fryer fucked up.
If you can't beat the memes, embrace them.
If you can't mix a Sugar Rush, you can't tend bar.
If you cannot scour this poison, I shall scour your meager life!
If you dare not continue down this path of madness, escape can be found through the chute in this room.
If you die in the game, you die for real!
If you eat enough, then eating will be all that you do.
If you ever wanted to drive a vegetarian to insanity, here's how.
If you got caught sneaking a peek from your teacher's spellbook, you'd likely be expelled from the Wizard Academy. Better not.
If you had a pickaxe you'd be a shaft FINEr.
If you have experience with the Nar-Sian cult (or the "blood cult") then you will know of runes. They are the manifestations of the Geometer's power, and where most of the cult's supernatural ability comes from. The Servant equivalent of runes is called <b>scripture</b>, and unlike runes, scripture is loaded into your clockwork slab.<br><br>
If you have this, tell a coder or admin!
If you mindswap from a mouse, they will be helpless when you recover...
If you see this something went very wrong.
If you see this something went wrong.
If you see this something's wrong, warn a coder.
If you see this, yell at adminbus.
If you see this, you're not likely to remember it any time soon.
If you strike me down, I shall become more robust than you can possibly imagine.
If you think you're confident in taking further steps to help the cult, feel free to move onto the other sections. If not, let your allies know that you're new and would appreciate the help they might offer you. Most experienced Servants would be happy to help; if everyone is inexperienced, then you'll have to step out of your comfort zone and read onto the other sections. It's very likely that you might fail, but don't worry too much about it; you can't learn effectively without making mistakes.<br><br>
If you want to get cancer, might as well do it in style.
If you were a carp I'd fi-lay you.
If you were a disposal bin I'd ride you all day.
If you were a taser, you'd be set to stunning.
If you were an abandoned station you'd be the DEARelict.
If you were smarter, you'd come back.
If you're feeling low, count on the buttery flavor of our own bastion bourbon.
If you're reading this description ingame, something has gone wrong! Honk!
If you're reading this it means I messed up. This is related to moths eating clothes and I didn't know a better way to do it than making a new food object.
If you're reading this: GET OUT! The mining go on here has unearthed something that was once-trapped by the layers of ice on this hell-hole. The overseer and Jouslen have gone missing. The officer is
	 keeping the rest of us on lockdown and I swear to god I keep hearing strange noises outside the walls at night. The gateway link has gone dead and without a supply of resources from Central, we're left
	 for dead here. We haven't heard anything back from the mining squad either, so I can only assume whatever the fuck they unearthed got them first before coming for us. I don't want to die here...
If you're seeing this someone has either made a mistake or gotten dangerously savvy with var editing!
If you're seeing this, file a bug report.
If your corpse is clad in funeral garments, you will be unable to resurrect.
If your corpse is destroyed, you will be unable to resurrect.
If your corpse is embalmed, you will be unable to resurrect.
If your corpse is filled with holy water, you will be unable to resurrect.
If your corpse is in a coffin, you will be unable to resurrect.
If your corpse is near lit candles, you will be unable to resurrect.
If your corpse is placed within a rune, you will be unable to resurrect.

In addition, do not intervene in situations you are not knowledgeable in, even for patients in whom the harm is visible; leave this operation to be performed by specialists.

In some obscure circles, this is known as the 'cloning tester's friend'.
In space construction the teleporter is often the first system brought online. This lonely half built teleporter is a sign of a proposed structure that for one reason or another just never got built.
In the darkest times, we will find our way home.
In the early stages of the cult, the only resource that must be actively worried about is components. However, as new scripture is unlocked, a new resource becomes necessary: <b>power</b>. Almost all clockwork structures require power to function in some way. There is nothing special about this power; it's mere electricity, and can be harnessed in several ways.<br><br>

Information on all formal jobs that can be assigned on Space Station 13 can be found on this document.<BR>
The data will be in the following form.<BR>
Generally lower ranking positions come first in this list.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Job Name</B>   general access>lab access-engine access-systems access (atmosphere control)<BR>
	Job Description<BR>
Job Duties (in no particular order)<BR>
Tips (where applicable)<BR>
<BR>
<B>Research Assistant</B> 1>1-0-0<BR>
	This is probably the lowest level position. Anyone who enters the space station after the initial job
assignment will automatically receive this position. Access with this is restricted. Head of Personnel should
appropriate the correct level of assistance.<BR>
1. Assist the researchers.<BR>
2. Clean up the labs.<BR>
3. Prepare materials.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Staff Assistant</B> 2>0-0-0<BR>
	This position assists the security officer in his duties. The staff assistants should primarily br
patrolling the ship waiting until they are needed to maintain ship safety.
(Addendum: Updated/Elevated Security Protocols admit issuing of low level weapons to security personnel)<BR>
1. Patrol ship/Guard key areas<BR>
2. Assist security officer<BR>
3. Perform other security duties.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Technical Assistant</B> 1>0-0-1<BR>
	This is yet another low level position. The technical assistant helps the engineer and the station
technician with the upkeep and maintenance of the station. This job is very important because it usually
gets to be a heavy workload on station technician and these helpers will alleviate that.<BR>
1. Assist Station technician and Engineers.<BR>
2. Perform general maintenance of station.<BR>
3. Prepare materials.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Medical Assistant</B> 1>1-0-0<BR>
	This is the fourth position yet it is slightly less common. This position doesn't have much power
outside of the med bay. Consider this position like a nurse who helps to upkeep medical records and the
materials (filling syringes and checking vitals)<BR>
1. Assist the medical personnel.<BR>
2. Update medical files.<BR>
3. Prepare materials for medical operations.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Research Technician</B> 2>3-0-0<BR>
	This job is primarily a step up from research assistant. These people generally do not get their own lab
but are more hands on in the experimentation process. At this level they are permitted to work as consultants to
the others formally.<BR>
1. Inform superiors of research.<BR>
2. Perform research alongside of official researchers.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Detective</B> 3>2-0-0<BR>
	This job is in most cases slightly boring at best. Their sole duty is to
perform investigations of crime scenes and analysis of the crime scene. This
alleviates SOME of the burden from the security officer. This person's duty
is to draw conclusions as to what happened and testify in court. Said person
also should store the evidence ly.<BR>
1. Perform crime-scene investigations/draw conclusions.<BR>
2. Store and catalogue evidence properly.<BR>
3. Testify to superiors/inquiries on findings.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Station Technician</B> 2>0-2-3<BR>
	People assigned to this position must work to make sure all the systems aboard Space Station 13 are operable.
They should primarily work in the computer lab and repairing faulty equipment. They should work with the
atmospheric technician.<BR>

Log 1:<br>We got our promised supply drop today. We were only meant to get it, what, a week ago? This bloody gateway keeps desyncing itself, and that means subsisting off recycled water and carb packs. No clue where the damn thing connects to on its off days, and HQ say we are 'not to touch it if it isn't linking to command.' We dumped off the assload of crates Jim filled, got our boxes of oxygen, food and drink, and closed the portal.<br><br>Log 2:<br>Damn thing is acting up again. Three days no contact this time. I thought I heard clanking noises from it yesterday. Jim is going on about the NT base or some shit. We've been over this before - They don't know we're here, that engineer was too drunk to recognize his suit, especially since I had it painted orange. He's starting to get annoying. We're safe.<br><br>Log 3:<br>Gateway synced itself up automatically today. I opened it for an instant to spy through it, got a glimpse of the inside of a transport container. Either HQ's redecorating or something, or there's more than two of these things.
Log 1:<br>While mining today I noticed the NT station was finished with its renovations. They placed some huge reinforced tumor on the station, looks so ugly. I wouldn't be surprised if those pigs decided to turn that little astronomy outpost into a prison with that thing, it'd be pretty typical of them.<br><br>Log 2:<br>Really dumb of me but I just waved at an engineer in the outpost, and he waved back. I hope to god he was too dumb or drunk to recognize the suit, because if he isn't then we might have to pull out before they come looking for us.<br><br>Log 3:<br>That huge reinforced tumor in their science section has been making a lot of noise lately. I've been hearing some banging and scratching from the other side and I'm kind of glad now that they reinforced this thing so much. I'll be sleeping with my gun under my pillow from now on.

Makes a large cloud of smoke that can carry reagents.
Makes a single target dizzy for a bit.

Makes a very bright flash.
Makes all your shredding needs possible.
Makes clown minions.
Makes death amusing.
Makes everyone around you more flammable, and lights yourself on fire.
Makes researched and prototype items with materials and energy.
Makes the target off balance and dizzy
Makes the wardenclyffe look like a child's plaything when shot with a particle accelerator.
Makes you impervious to stuns and grants a stamina regeneration buff, but you will be a nearly uncontrollable tramp-bearded raving lunatic.
Makes you invisible for short periods of time. Recharges in darkness.
Makes you not see anything.
Makes you s-s-stuttterrr.
Makes you want to frolic in a field of daisies.
Makes your KA orange. All the fun of having explosive blasts without actually having explosive blasts.
Makes your KA yellow. All the fun of having a more powerful KA without actually having a more powerful KA.

Nothing
Nothing could possibly go wrong with arming a crew of lunatics just itching for an excuse to kill you. There is a good chance that they will shoot each other first.
Nothing gets between you and your food. You eat faster and can binge on junk food! Being fat suits you just fine.
Nothing good can come from this. Learn from their mistakes and turn around.
Nothing is being built.
Nothing is more terrifying than clowns with fully automatic weaponry.
Nothing like a good drink to make you feel on top of the world. Whenever you're drunk, you slowly recover from injuries.
Nothing new but the name: %product_name% not quite exciting %jobs%
Nothing of interest to report.
Nothing of real interest to report this month. I have intercepted faint transmissions from what appears to be some sort of pirate radio station. They do not appear to be relevant to my assignment.
Nothing says tasty like maggot filled radioactive mutant flesh.
Nothing to cry over.
Nothing to see here citizen, move along, certainly no xeno outbreaks on this piece of station debris. That purple stuff? It's uh... station nectar. It's a top secret research installation.
Nothing!

One of CentCom's janitors made a small fortune betting on carp races. Now they'd like to commission an upgrade to their floor buffer.
One of Central Command's trading routes was recently disrupted by a raid carried out by the Gorlex Marauders. They seemed to only be after one ship - a highly-sensitive transport containing a nuclear fission explosive, although it is useless without the proper code and authorization disk. While the code was likely found in minutes, the only disk that can activate this explosive is on your station. Ensure that it is protected at all times, and remain alert for possible intruders.
One of Ratvar's four generals. Before becoming one of Ratvar's generals, Nzcrentr sook out any and all sentient life to slaughter it for sport. Nzcrentr was coerced by Ratvar into entering a shell constructed by Nezbere, ostensibly made to grant Nzcrentr more power. In reality, the shell was made to trap and control it. Nzcrentr now serves loyally, though even one of Nezbere's finest creations was not enough to totally eliminate its will.
One of Ratvar's four generals. Before her current form, Inath-neq was a powerful warrior priestess commanding the Resonant Cogs, a sect of Ratvarian warriors renowned for their prowess. After a lost battle with Nar-Sian cultists, Inath-neq was struck down and stated in her dying breath, "The Resonant Cogs shall not fall silent this day, but will come together to form a wheel that shall never stop turning." Ratvar, touched by this, granted Inath-neq an eternal body and merged her soul with those of the Cogs slain with her on the battlefield.
One of Ratvar's four generals. Nezbere is responsible for the design, testing, and creation of everything in Ratvar's domain, and his loyalty to Ratvar knows no bounds. It is said that Ratvar once asked him to destroy the plans for a weapon Nezbere had made that could have harmed him, and Nezbere responded by not only destroying the plans, but by taking his own life so that the device could never be replicated. Nezbere's zealotry is unmatched.
One of Ratvar's four generals. Sevtug taught him how to manipulate minds and is one of his oldest allies. Sevtug serves Ratvar loyally out of a hope that one day, he will be able to use a moment of weakness in the Justicar to usurp him, but such a day will never come. And so, he serves with dedication, if not necessarily any sort of decorum, never aware he is the one being made a fool of.
One of Ratvar's generals.

One of the more successful achievements of the Nanotrasen Corporate Warfare Division, their nuclear fission explosives are renowned for being cheap to produce and devastatingly effective. Signs explain that though this particular device has been decommissioned, every Nanotrasen station is equipped with an equivalent one, just in case. All Captains carefully guard the disk needed to detonate them - at least, the sign says they do. There seems to be a tap on the back.

Personal Log - Kenneth Cunningham
Personal Log for Research Director Gerald Rosswell<br><br>Entry One - 17/05/2554:<br>You know, I can't believe I took this position so suddenly. I saw that corporate needed a research director for one of it's outposts and thought it would be a cakewalk, there isn't going to be a lot of research to be done on a tiny outpost. Mainly just running scans on the gas giant we are orbiting or some basic RnD. However, they conveniently forgot to tell me that me and my science staff would have to pull double duty as medical staff and that there is no one higher up on the chain of command here, so I get to pull triple duty as acting captain as well! This shit is probably allowed in some 3 point fine print buried underneath the literally thousands of pages of contracts. Well, at least the research will be easy work.<br><br>Entry Two - 25/05/2554:<br>Well, we all expected it at the outpost, CentCom has decided to completely change what research we are doing. They've decided that we should be research the species known as 'xenomporphs'. They announced this change 4 days ago and along with it, sadly, the termination of our current science staff barring me. Not to mention the constant noise made by the construction detail they sent to staple on an xenobiology lab ensuring no one has been able to sleep decently ever since they announced the shift. To make matters worse our current security guard actually died of a heart attack today. Just goes to show that 75 year old men shouldn't be security guards. Still can't believe that they decided to do this major change less than a month after the outpost was established.<br><br>Entry Three - 27/05/2554:<br>The new security guard arrived today. Apparently transferred here from the research station that also is orbiting the gas giant. He seems to be rather angry about his transfer. Considering the rumors I've heard about the research station he's probably caught off guard by the fact that Steve hasn't tried to force an IED down his throat.<br><br>Entry Four - 06/06/2554:<br>My requests for additional security and containment measures for the 'xenomorph' has been denied. Does Central Command not notice how dangerous these creatures are? The only thing keeping them in is a force field, a minor problem with the power grid and the entire hive is loose. What would stop them then, the lone security guard with a dinky little taser? Kenneth can barely handle a short-tempered engineer. We are under equipped and under staffed, we are inevitably going to be destroyed unless we get the equipment and staff we need.<br><br>Entry Five - 10/06/2554:<br>Cunningham got a good look at the xenomorph in containment. He was frightened for the rest of the day, rather amusing if it wasn't for the fact that we are all trapped on this scrap heap with naught but a force field keeping those xenomorphs in.<br><br>Entry Six - 17/06/2554:<br>The reactions from the specimens today has shown that they possess strange mental properties. Mark hypothesizes that they possibly have a sort of hive mind, while nothing is certain this would explain how xenomorphs seem to have vastly increased intellect when a 'queen' is present. Of course, to test this hypothesis would require many complicated procedures which we will not be able to undertake. But we do not know the full extend of the xenomorph mind, it may or may not be able to find a way to circumvent our containment system. I will resend my request for additional security measures along with this new found information.

Reports of an ancient ÿ outbreak that turn humans into monkeys has been reported in your quadrant.  Any such infections may be treated with banana juice.  If an outbreak occurs, ensure the station is quarantined to prevent a largescale outbreak at CentCom.
Reports of psychic activity have been showing up in this sector, and we believe this may have to do with a containment breach on [REDACTED] last month when a sapient hive intelligence displaying paranormal powers escaped into the unknown. They present a very large risk as they can assimilate people into the hivemind with ease, although they appear unable to affect mindshielded personnel.

Researcher: <u>Dr. Mark Douglas    </u><br>Date: <u>04/06/2554</u><br><br>Report:<br>After an extremely dangerous, time consuming and costly dissection, we have managed to record and identify several of the organs inside of the first stage of the xenomorph cycle: the larva. This procedure took an extensive amount of time because these creatures have incredibly, almost-comically acidic blood that can melt through almost anything in a few moments. We had to use over a dozen scalpels and retractors to complete the autopsy.<br><br>The larva seems to possess far fewer and quite different organs than that of a human. There is a stomach, with no digestive tract, a heart, which seems to lack any blood-oxygen circulation purpose, and an elongated brain, even though its as dumb as any large cat. It also lacks any liver, kidneys, or other basic organs.<br><br>We can't determine the exact nature of how these creatures grow, nor if they gain organs as they become adults. The larger breeds of xenomorph are too dangerous to kill and capture to give us an accurate answer to these questions. All that we can conclude is that being able to function with so little and yet be so deadly means that these creatures are highly evolved and likely to be extremely durable to various hazards that would otherwise be lethal to humans.
Researcher: <u>Dr. Mark Douglas    </u><br>Date: <u>06/06/2554</u><br><br>Report:<br>While observing the growing number of aliens in the containment cell, we began to notice subtle differences that were consistently repeating. Like ants, these creatures clearly have different specialized variations that determine their roles in the hive. We have dubbed the three currently observed castes as Hunters, Drones, and Sentinels.<br><br>Hunters have been observed to be by far the most aggressive and agile of the three, constantly running on every surface and frequently swiping at the windows. They are also remarkably good at camouflaging themselves in darkness and on their resin structures, appearing almost invisible to the unwary observer. They are always the first to reach the monkeys we send in leading us to believe that this caste is primarily used for finding and retrieving hosts.<br><br>Drones on the other hand are much more docile and seem more shy by comparison, though not any less aggressive than the other castes. They have been observed to have a much wider head and lack dorsal tubes. They have shown to be less agile and visibly more fragile than any other caste. The drone however has never been observed to interact with the monkeys directly and instead preferring maintenance of the hive by building walls of resin and moving eggs around the nest. As far as we know, we have only ever observed a drone become a queen, and we have no way of knowing if the other castes have that capability.<br><br>Lastly, we have the Sentinels, which appear at first glance to be the guards of the hive.  They have so far been only observed to remain near the queen and the eggs, frequently curled up against the walls. We have only observed one instance where they have interacted with a monkey who strayed too closely to the queen, and was pounced and held down immediately until it was applied with a facehugger. Their lack of movement makes it difficult to determine their exact purpose as guards, sentries, or other role.
Researcher: <u>Dr. Mark Douglas    </u><br>Date: <u>17/06/2554</u><br><br>Report:<br>Earlier today we have observed a new phenomenon with our subjects. While feeding them our last monkey subject and throwing out the box, the aliens merely looked at us instead of infecting the monkey right away. They looked to be collectively distressed as they would no longer be given hosts, where instead we would move to the next phase of the experiment. When I glanced at the gas tanks and piping leading to their cell, I looked back to see all of them were up against the glass, even the queen! It was as if they all understood what was going to happen, even though we knew only the queen had the cognitive capability to do so.<br><br>The only explanation for this is a form of communication between the aliens, but we have seen no such action take place anywhere in the cell until now. We also know that regular drone and hunter xenomorphs have no personality or instinct to survive by themselves. Perhaps the queen has a direct link to them? A form of a commander or overseer that controls their every move? A hivemind?
Researcher: <u>Dr. Sakuma Sano    </u><br>Date: <u>03/06/2554</u><br><br>Report:<br>The other scientists and I can hardly believe our eyes. The snake-like larva has molted into a 7 foot tall insectoid nightmare in just a few hours. It's obvious now as to why such heavy duty containment was needed. It immediately tried to escape however by flinging itself at the window in a flurry of swipes and stabs. It seems its behavior has returned to a state that is very similar to the facehugger, though I doubt with the same intent! Thankfully, our glass and shields have shown to be more than sturdy enough for such a violent creature, and so far, any attempts at the creature escaping have been in vain.<br><br>As for its physiology, the creature has an elongated head with what appears to be have an exoskeleton resembling an external rib-cage on the torso. The alien is also fairly skinny with a lean body. The little amount of meat on the alien appears to be entirely muscle.  We assume this makes it deceptively strong, while remaining agile at the same time.  One of the most interesting things we have seen is its pharyngeal jaw.  It has some what of an inner mouth capable of being fired externally at extremely high speeds. It has already caused many dents in the walls and a few small cracks in the window with it. The alien also has a couple of dorsal tubes on its back, their purpose unknown. Finally, this monster sports a long ridged tail, complete with a large and extremely sharp blade at the tip.<br><br>Normally I would be absolutely terrified of something like this, but I'm putting my trust in Nanotrasen with the containment. After all, they wouldn't build a cell that could fail to contain its subject, would they?
Researcher: <u>Dr. Sakuma Sano    </u><br>Date: <u>03/06/2554</u><br><br>Report:<br>The test subject we were provided with truly is alien. It is a small spider-like creature with bony legs leading to a smooth body. It has a long tail connected to it, and it has shown extremely aggressive behavior by flinging its entire body at the glass and shields to no avail. While doing so, we noticed there was a small pink hole in the middle of the body.<br><br>When we sent in a monkey through the crude but effective disposal tube, the alien immediately jumped at its face and latched on. The monkey was quickly suffocated by its constricting tail, unable to pry off the fingers. The monkey at first seemed to be dead, but was observed to be breathing. The recently named alien 'facehugger' fell off dead and curled its legs up like a spider moments after it had finished with the monkey's body.<br><br>While the monkey appeared to be unharmed, we kept it in the cell for a couple more hours until we were horrified to discover it screaming out in pain as a snake-like creature erupted from the monkey's chest! It appears that the 'facehugger' is only the start of this life cycle. The impregnation cycle involving the creatures growing inside the chests of their hosts seems to only be the beginning.
Researcher: <u>Dr. Sakuma Sano    </u><br>Date: <u>03/06/2554</u><br><br>Report:<br>When the larva first emerged from the chest of the monkey, it seemed very curious. It would wander around aimlessly for awhile and then sit still. We are unable to determine the gender of the larva, or even determine if it has a gender. After some time had passed, it seemed to lose interest in its surroundings and sat mostly still while occasionally wagging its tail. We decided to throw in a live mouse to see if it would consume it. The larva quickly attacked and ate the mouse and seemed to get larger very suddenly, this suggests that the larvae are capable of metabolizing and directing all the energy towards growth at previously thought impossible speeds. It is a shame that we cannot observe the process more closely, as we do not currently know how dangerous or violent this creature is or will become as it matures fully.<br><br>It is tempting to imagine the possibilities of utilizing such a mechanism. The capability of skipping years of growth time for children, repairing bodily damage in a matter of moments, even its usage in existing cloning technology.
Researcher: <u>Dr. Sakuma Sano    </u><br>Date: <u>04/06/2554</u><br><br>Report:<br>As expected, all that is left of the monkeys we sent in earlier is a group of xenomorph larvae. It is quite clear that the facehuggers are not selective in their hosts, and so far the gestation process has been shown to have a 100% success rate.<br><br>The larvae themselves have been behaving very differently from the lone larva we first observed, and despite shying away from humans they are clearly comfortable with others of their kind. Our previous suspicions on larvae have been confirmed with their demonstration of playfulness: they are not nearly as aggressive or violent when young, before molting to adulthood.<br><br>The majority of the play we observed involved a sort of hide-and-seek, and occasionally wrestling by tangling themselves and struggling out of it. While normally we would write these off as instinctual play for honing their skills when they molt, their growth period is so incredibly fast and they are still such adept killers that it would serve no practical purpose. The only explanation for this is perhaps to create bonds and friendships with each other, if that is even possible for such an incredibly hostile race. It may be that they are much more reasonable with each other than other life forms.<br><br>It had become clear that now was the best time to extract a xenomorph for dissecting, as these were all still larvae and the queen was still attached to its ovipositor and would be immobile. With the approval of the research director, we sent in our medical robot that had been dubbed 'Head Surgeon' into the containment pen, dropping the shields for only a fraction of a second to allow it entry. The larvae were cautious, but the curiosity of one had him within grabbing range of our robot. It was brought out and quickly euthanized through lethal injection, courtesy of our mechanical doctor.
Researcher: <u>Dr. Sakuma Sano    </u><br>Date: <u>04/06/2554</u><br><br>Report:<br>I have studied many interesting and diverse life-forms as a xenobiologist ranging from creatures as large as cows, to specimens too small see with the naked eye. This is by far the largest alien I have ever seen. The alien we were previously studying has molted and has become an absolutely enormous creature. Standing at over 15 feet tall and weighing in at likely two tons or more, the xenomorph queen is an absolutely breathtakingly large and cruel monster. Its behavior has changed drastically from when it was a drone, having become far more comfortable with sitting and staring at us, rather than smashing at the windows.<br><br>The queen, physiologically speaking, is fairly similar to the other xenomorphs, with a few key differences. Its enormous size demands large legs, while the back seems to be always hunched forward. The dorsal tubes on the back have changed to several large spikes, and we observed the alien now sports a second pair of smaller arms on its chest.  The purpose of these secondary arms is still unknown. Finally, the queen's crown has become incredibly large, with what seems to be a retractable slot to hide its head in. The dome appears to be extremely thick near the front, and will likely be able to resist a lot of trauma. Despite the enormous size it has grown to, it is not that much slower than it used to be.<br><br>After two hours of doing relatively nothing but staring, the queen began to produce an unusually large amount of resin and weeds, quickly shaping up a large nest that it then hid behind. It then proceeded to smash out all the lights, leaving us with very little to see with our cameras. When we looked through the back cameras, we had discovered that it had grown a large ovipositor, and was releasing large eggs onto the ground. This had us all in agreement that this stage of the life cycle was the queen.<br><br>Over the next few hours, the eggs grew to their full sizes, and we provided the subject with new monkey hosts. When they approached the eggs, they opened to release more facehuggers. It seems that we have observed the full cycle of reproduction for this species. We can expect more larvae in the next few hours.
Researcher: <u>Dr. Sakuma Sano    </u><br>Date: <u>08/06/2554</u><br><br>Report:<br>The xenomorphs we have come to study here are a remarkable species. They are almost universally aggressive across all castes, showing no remorse or guilt or pause before or after acts of violence. They appear to be a species entirely designed to kill. Oddly enough, even their method of reproduction is a brutal two-for-one method of birthing a new xenomorph and killing its host.<br><br>The lone xenomorph we studied only five days ago showed little sign of intelligence. Only a simple drone that flung itself at the safety glass and shields repeatedly and thankfully without success. Once the drone molted into a queen, it became much more calm and calculating, merely looking at us and waiting while building its nest. As the hive grew in size and in numbers, so too did the intelligence of the common hunter and drone. We are still researching how they can communicate with one another and the relationship between the different castes and the queen. We will continue to update our research as we learn more about the species.

Sightings of a giant wad of paper hurling through the depths of space have been recently reported by multiple outposts near this sector. A giant wad of paper, really? Damn prank callers.
Sightings of strange alien creatures have been observed in your area. These aliens supposedly possess the ability to enslave unwitting personnel and leech from their power. Be wary of dark areas and ensure all lights are kept well-maintained. Closely monitor all crew for suspicious behavior and perform dethralling surgery if they have obvious tells. Investigate all reports of odd or suspicious sightings in maintenance.

Some plain old earthen bread.
Some rods. Can be used for building or something.
Some say that this is the best medicine, but recent studies have proven that to be untrue.
Some shavings from a tall mushroom. With enough, might serve as a bowl.
Some sleeping agents have managed to get aboard. Their objective is to stage a coup and take over the station stealthly.
Some sort of bizarre assembly made from a proximity sensor, helmet, and signaler.
Some sort of bizarre assembly.
Some sort of transmitter? It seems as though it's trying to say something.
Some space miners still cling to the old way of getting that sweet, sweet plasma - painstakingly digging it out of free-floating asteroidsinstead of flying down to the hellscape of lavaland.
Some speculate that this virus is the cause of the Space Wizard Federation's existence. Subjects affected show the signs of mental retardation, yelling obscure sentences or total gibberish. On late stages subjects sometime express the feelings of inner power, and, cite, 'the ability to control the forces of cosmos themselves!' A gulp of strong, manly spirits usually reverts them to normal, humanlike, condition.
Some stations in your sector have reported evidence of blood sacrifice and strange magic. Ties to the Wizards' Federation have been proven not to exist, and many employees have disappeared; even Central Command employees light-years away have felt strange presences and at times hysterical compulsions. Interrogations point towards this being the work of the cult of Nar-Sie. If evidence of this cult is discovered aboard your station, extreme caution and extreme vigilance must be taken going forward, and all resources should be devoted to stopping this cult. Note that holy water seems to weaken and eventually return the minds of cultists that ingest it, and mindshield implants will prevent conversion altogether.
Some tan pants. You look like a white collar worker with these on.

Something's gone VERY wrong here. Jouslen has been mumbling about some weird shit in his cabin during the night and he seems always tired when we're working. I tried to confront him about it and he blew up on me,
	 telling me to mind my own business. I reported him to the officer, said he'd look into it. We only got another 2 months here before we're pulled for another assignment, so this shit can't go any quicker...

The Gorlex Marauders have announced the successful raid and destruction of Central Command containment ship #S-ÿ. This ship housed only a single prisoner - codenamed "Thing", and it was highly adaptive and extremely dangerous. We have reason to believe that the Thing has allied with the Syndicate, and you should note that likelihood of the Thing being sent to a station in this sector is highly likely. It may be in the guise of any crew member. Trust nobody - suspect everybody. Do not announce this to the crew, as paranoia may spread and inhibit workplace efficiency.

The Syndicate bomb is a fearsome device capable of massive destruction. It has an adjustable timer, with a minimum of 60 seconds, and can be bolted to the floor with a wrench to prevent movement. The bomb is bulky and cannot be moved; upon ordering this item, a smaller beacon will be transported to you that will teleport the actual bomb to it upon activation. Note that this bomb can be defused, and some crew may attempt to do so. The bomb core can be pried out and manually detonated with other explosives.
The Syndicate detonator is a companion device to the Syndicate bomb. Simply press the included button and an encrypted radio frequency will instruct all live Syndicate bombs to detonate. Useful for when speed matters or you wish to synchronize multiple bomb blasts. Be sure to stand clear of the blast radius before using the detonator.
The Syndicate has started some experimental research regarding humanoid shapeshifting.  There are rumors that this technology will be field tested on a Nanotrasen station for infiltration purposes.  Be advised that support personel may also be deployed to defend these shapeshifters. Trust nobody - suspect everybody. Do not announce this to the crew, as paranoia may spread and inhibit workplace efficiency.
The Syndicate have cunningly disguised a Syndicate Uplink as your PDA. Simply enter the code "678 Bravo" into the ringtone select to unlock its hidden features. <br><br><b>Objective #1</b>. Kill the God damn AI in a fire blast that it rocks the station. <b>Success!</b>  <br><b>Objective #2</b>. Escape alive. <b>Failed.</b>

We adjust our eyes to protect them from bright lights.
We adjust our eyes to sense prey through walls.
We all love tofu.
We are deploying an experimental plasma decontamination system. Please stand away from the vents and do not breathe the smoke that comes out.
We arise once more.
We assume direct control of one of our vessels, leaving our current body for up to ten seconds, although a larger hive may be able to sustain it for up to two minutes. It can be cancelled at any time by casting it again. Powers can be used via our vessel, although if it dies, the entire hivemind will come down with it.
We attune our senses to track other changelings by scent.  The closer they are, the easier we can find them.
We barely understand the brains of terrestial animals. Who knows what we may find in the brain of such an advanced species?
We can use it once to retrieve a distant item. If used on living creatures, the effect depends on the intent: Help will simply drag them closer, Disarm will grab whatever they're holding instead of them, Grab will put the victim in our hold after catching it, and Harm will stun it, and stab it if we're also holding a sharp weapon. Cannot be used while in lesser form.
We can't adjust our eyes if we don't have any!
We cannot be tracked by camera or seen by AI units while using this skill. However, humans looking at us will find us... uncanny.
We cannot evolve this ability.
We cause mass terror to our victim.
We change into a human. Costs 5 chemicals.
We couldn't assign an ID!
We debase ourselves and become lesser. We become a monkey. Costs 5 chemicals.
We evolve additional sacs of adrenaline throughout our body. Costs 30 chemicals.
We evolve past the person we were a minute before. Little by little we advance with each turn. That's how a drill works!
We evolve the ability to reduce the acid buildup in our muscles, allowing us to move much faster.
We evolve the ability to sting a target with a powerful hallucinogenic chemical. The target does not notice they have been stung, and the effect occurs after 30 to 60 seconds.
We fall into a stasis, allowing us to regenerate and trick our enemies.
We fall into a stasis, allowing us to regenerate and trick our enemies. Costs 15 chemicals.
We go together like the clown and the external airlock.
We grow an organic suit to protect ourselves from space exposure. Costs 20 chemicals.
We have already evolved this ability!
We have reached our capacity for abilities.
We have received some fuzzy reports about the Syndicate cooperating with a bluespace demon.Keep a watch out for syndicate agents, and have your Chaplain on standby.
We have the technology to make him.
We have the technology to rebuild him.
We have the technology to upgrade him.
We haven't prepared our sting yet!
We heard that moths such as yourself really like lamps, so we decided to grant you early access to a prototype Syndicate brand "Extra-Bright Lanternâ¢". Enjoy.
We lack the energy to evolve new abilities right now.
We lack the energy to evolve this ability!
We like plants!;Don't you want some?;The greenest thumbs ever.;We like big plants.;Soft soil...
We like plants!;Grow some crops!;Grow, baby, growww!;Aw h'yeah son!
We link our victim's mind into the hivemind for personal interrogation.
We may retract our armblade in the same manner as we form it. Cannot be used while in lesser form.
We must constantly repair our form to make it space-proof, reducing chemical production while we are protected. Cannot be used in lesser form.
We overload the target's medulla, inducing an immediate heart attack.
We probe the mind of an adjacent target and extract valuable information on any enemy hives they may belong to. Takes longer if the target is not in our hive.
We ready a tentacle to grab items or victims with. Costs 10 chemicals.
We reform one of our arms into a deadly blade. Costs 20 chemicals.
We reform one of our arms into a hard shield. Costs 20 chemicals.
We sacrifice our current body in a moment of need, placing us in control of a vessel that can plant our likeness in a new host. Costs 20 chemicals.
We shape our vocal glands to sound like a desired voice. Maintaining this power slows chemical production.
We shift our vocal cords to release a high-frequency sound that overloads nearby electronics. Costs 20 chemicals.
We should store bank records in a webscale datastore, like /dev/null.
We silently add an unsuspecting target to the hive.
We silently remove a nearby target from the hive. We must be close to their body to do so.
We silently sting a human, completely silencing them for a short time. Costs 20 chemicals.
We silently sting a human, injecting a retrovirus that forces them to transform. Costs 50 chemicals.
We silently sting a human, injecting a retrovirus that mutates their arm to temporarily appear as an armblade. Costs 20 chemicals.
We silently sting our victim with a cocktail of chemicals that freezes them from the inside. Costs 15 chemicals.
We take on the appearance and voice of one we have absorbed. Costs 5 chemicals.
We temporarily blind our victim. Costs 25 chemicals.
We tune our senses to the airwaves to allow us to discreetly communicate and exchange DNA with other changelings.
We turn our skin into tough chitin to protect us from damage. Costs 20 chemicals.
We unleash a burst of psionic energy, inducing a debilitating fear in those around us and reducing their combat readiness. Mindshielded foes have a chance to resist this power.
We use the eyes of one of our vessels. Use again to look through our own eyes once more.
We warp reality surrounding a vessel, causing hallucinations in everybody around them over a short period of time, eventually weakening those caught within the field. This power's effectiveness scales with hive size.
We will be able to talk with other changelings with :g. Exchanged DNA do not count towards absorb objectives.
We will be placed in control of a small, fragile creature. We may attack a corpse like this to plant an egg which will slowly mature into a new form for us.
We will continue to monitor their stocks as the situation unfolds.
We will know the general direction of nearby changelings, with closer scents being stronger.  Our chemical generation is slowed while this is active.
We'd ask them to stop blaring that ruskiepop music, but none of us are brave enough to go near those death turrets they have.
We'll pay.
We're leaving together
But still it's farewell
And maybe we'll come back
To Earth, who can tell?
We're upgrading to the latest mainframes for our consoles, the shipment should be in before spring break is over!
We've discovered something floating in space. We can't really tell how old it is, but it is scraped and bent to hell. There object is the size of about a room with double doors that we have yet to break into.   It is a lot sturdier than we could have imagined.  We have decided to call it 'The Vault'

When a problem arises, SCIENCE is the solution.
When activated, this crystal allows you to take over small animals, and then exit them at the possessors leisure. Exiting the animal kills it, and if you die while possessing the animal, you die as well.
When activated, this crystal revives anyone nearby, but turns them into Shadowpeople and makes them unclonable, making the crystal their only hope of getting up again.
When adamantine resonates, it causes all nearby pieces of adamantine to resonate as well. Adamantine golems use this to broadcast messages to nearby golems.
When attacked or killed, wets nearby tiles, extinguishing anything on them.
When attacked with brute damage, will lash out, attacking everything near it.
When attacked, may shift away from the attacker.
When attacked, spreads damage between all blobs near the attacked blob.
When entered the uplink will self-destruct immediately.
When everything's going to crab, protecting your head is the best choice.
When evolution isn't fast enough.
When inserted into a personal digital assistant, this cartridge gives you five PDA viruses which when used cause the targeted PDA to become a new uplink with zero TCs, and immediately become unlocked. You will receive the unlock code upon activating the virus, and the new uplink may be charged with telecrystals normally.
When inserted into a personal digital assistant, this cartridge gives you four opportunities to detonate PDAs of crewmembers who have their message feature enabled. The concussive effect from the explosion will knock the recipient out for a short period, and deafen them for longer.
When life gives you lemons, don't make lemonade. Make life take the lemons back! Get mad! I don't want your damn lemons!
When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.
When not acting in self defense, you must always offer your victim food before harming them.
When not in immediate danger, if you are challenged to a dance off, you must accept it. You are not obligated to face off with the same person twice.
When not in immediate danger, if you are challenged to a musical duel, you must accept it.  You are not obligated to duel the same person twice.
When screwed to wiring attached to a power grid and activated, this large device lights up and places excessive load on the grid, causing a station-wide blackout. The sink is large and cannot be stored in most traditional bags and boxes. Caution: Will explode if the powernet contains sufficient amounts of energy.
When screwed to wiring attached to an electric grid and activated, this large device pulls any active gravitational singularities or tesla balls towards it. This will not work when the engine is still in containment. Because of its size, it cannot be carried. Ordering this sends you a small beacon that will teleport the larger beacon to your location upon activation.
When simple medicine doesn't cut it.
When the engineers wish to chat like girls.
When the inspector told the employees that they were all fired, and that their jobs "could be done by trained lizards anyway", they reacted badly. This event and others is the reason why Central always sends an ERT squad with their competent inspectors. Incompetent inspectors are told they can "do it alone" because they're "that pro". Incompetent inspectors believe this.
When the station falls into chaos, it's nice to have a friend by your side.
When this pops, things are gonna get more aware around here.
When this pops, you're not going to be around here anymore.
When triggered, sends another signal to a relay channel, optionally with a delay.
When triggered, sends another signal to the nanites, optionally with a delay.
When used with an upload console, this module allows you to upload priority laws to an artificial intelligence. Be careful with wording, as artificial intelligences may look for loopholes to exploit.
When what a Devil really needs is funk.
When you get what they have, then you'll finally be happy.
When you need seeds fast!

With a suit lined with this many pockets, you are ready to operate.
With great power, comes great crepes.  It looks like a pancake filled with jelly but packs quite a punch.
With heated debates over the legality of the catperson and their status in the workforce, there's always a place for the blackmarket to slip in for some cash. Whether the results are morally sound or not is another issue entirely.
With humanity's current technological level, it could take years to hack this advanced airlock... or maybe we should give a screwdriver a try?
With no survivors!
With the price of rechargers on the rise, upper management is interested in purchasing guns that are self-powered. If you ship one, they'll pay.
With this device...
Without a doubt
Without power, many structures will not function, making a base vulnerable to attack. For this reason, it is critical that you keep an eye on your power reserves and ensure that they remain comfortably high.<br><br>

lets out a faint chimper as it collapses and stops moving...

lets out a tinny alarm before falling dark.
lets out a waning guttural screech, green blood bubbling from its maw...

requestEvac(): There is no emergency shuttle, but the shuttle was called. Using the backup shuttle instead.
requestEvac(): There is no emergency shuttle, or backup shuttle! The game will be unresolvable. This is possibly a mapping error, more likely a bug with the shuttle manipulation system, or badminry. It is possible to manually resolve this problem by loading an emergency shuttle template manually, and then calling register() on the mobile docking port. Good luck.

you
you hear a bangammer stroking a head
you hear a banhammer banning someone
you shouldn't see this
you shouldnt see this
you too?
you were a doctor on one of Nanotrasen's space stations, but you left behind that damn corporation's tyranny and everything it stood for. From a metaphorical hell to a literal one, you find yourself nonetheless missing the recycled air and warm floors of what you left behind... but you'd still rather be here than there.</b>
you were a ÿ's assistant on a small trading station several sectors from here. Raiders attacked, and there was only one pod left when you got to the escape bay. You took it and launched it alone, and the crowd of terrified faces crowding at the airlock door as your pod's engines burst to life and sent you to this hell are forever branded into your memory.</b>
you were always joked about by your friends for "not playing with a full deck", as they so <i>kindly</i> put it. It seems that they were right when you, on a tour at one of Nanotrasen's state-of-the-art research facilities, were in one of the escape pods alone and saw the red button. It was big and shiny, and it caught your eye. You pressed it, and after a terrifying and fast ride for days, you landed here. You've had time to wisen up since then, and you think that your old friends wouldn't be laughing now.</b>
you're an exile from the Tiger Cooperative. Their technological fanaticism drove you to question the power and beliefs of the Exolitics, and they saw you as a heretic and subjected you to hours of horrible torture. You were hours away from execution when a high-ranking friend of yours in the Cooperative managed to secure you a pod, scrambled its destination's coordinates, and launched it. You awoke from stasis when you landed and have been surviving - barely - ever since.</b>
